# API-Documentation
This repo is to store all of the public documentation on interacting with the ClicknClear APIs.

# Using the documentation
In this repo there are currently two files which provide the main docs for the ClicknClear APIs

## Postman Collection (Recommended)
The file `Main.postman_collection.json` is an export

## Swagger Docs
The `swagger-docs.yml` file is an automatic conversion of the "Main.postman_collection.json" file using the command line tool [p2o](https://joolfe.github.io/postman-to-openapi/)
